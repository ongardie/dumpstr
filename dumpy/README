Dumpy is the logo for dumpstr. It was created by Matt Melvin of
http://mattmelvin.com and is used in dumpstr with his permission. Matt would
prefer uses of dumpy in dumpstr to link to mattmelvin.com and sent me (Diego
Ongaro) the large dumpy.png file in this directory to use. I created the
dumpy.svg file as a trace of dumpy.png using Inkscape.
